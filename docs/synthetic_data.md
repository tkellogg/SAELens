# Training SAEs on Synthetic Data

Training SAEs on synthetic data allows you to work with a known ground truth, enabling precise evaluation of how well your SAE recovers the true underlying features. This is useful for:

- **Controlled experiments**: Test SAE architectures and hyperparameters with known feature structures
- **Fast iteration**: Train on CPU in under a minute with small models
- **Algorithm development**: Benchmark new training methods against ground truth

For a hands-on walkthrough, see the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/decoderesearch/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/training_saes_on_synthetic_data.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/decoderesearch/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/training_saes_on_synthetic_data.ipynb).

## Core Concepts

### Feature Dictionary

A [FeatureDictionary][sae_lens.synthetic.FeatureDictionary] maps sparse feature activations to dense hidden activations. It stores a matrix of feature vectors and computes `hidden = features @ feature_vectors + bias`.


```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import FeatureDictionary, orthogonal_initializer

# Create dictionary with 16 features in 32-dimensional space
feature_dict = FeatureDictionary(
    num_features=16,
    hidden_dim=32,
    initializer=orthogonal_initializer(),  # Makes features orthogonal
)
```

Use `orthogonal_initializer()` to create features that don't overlap, making it easier to evaluate SAE performance.

### Activation Generator

An [ActivationGenerator][sae_lens.synthetic.ActivationGenerator] samples sparse feature activations with controlled firing probabilities.

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import ActivationGenerator
import torch

firing_probs = torch.ones(16) * 0.25  # Each feature fires 25% of the time

activation_gen = ActivationGenerator(
    num_features=16,
    firing_probabilities=firing_probs,
)

# Sample a batch of sparse feature activations
feature_activations = activation_gen.sample(batch_size=1024)
```

## Basic Training Workflow

Use [train_toy_sae][sae_lens.synthetic.train_toy_sae] to train an SAE on synthetic data:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import (
    FeatureDictionary,
    ActivationGenerator,
    train_toy_sae,
)
from sae_lens import StandardTrainingSAE, StandardTrainingSAEConfig
import torch

# 1. Create feature dictionary and activation generator
feature_dict = FeatureDictionary(num_features=16, hidden_dim=32)
activation_gen = ActivationGenerator(
    num_features=16,
    firing_probabilities=torch.ones(16) * 0.25,
)

# 2. Configure SAE
cfg = StandardTrainingSAEConfig(
    d_in=feature_dict.hidden_dim,
    d_sae=feature_dict.num_features,
    l1_coefficient=5e-2,
)
sae = StandardTrainingSAE(cfg)

# 3. Train
train_toy_sae(sae, feature_dict, activation_gen)
```

## Evaluation

Use [eval_sae_on_synthetic_data][sae_lens.synthetic.eval_sae_on_synthetic_data] to measure how well the SAE recovers the true features:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import eval_sae_on_synthetic_data

result = eval_sae_on_synthetic_data(sae, feature_dict, activation_gen)
print(f"MCC: {result.mcc:.3f}")  # Mean Correlation Coefficient
print(f"Explained variance: {result.explained_variance:.3f}")  # R²
print(f"Uniqueness: {result.uniqueness:.3f}")  # Fraction of unique latents
print(f"L0: {result.sae_l0:.1f}")  # Average active latents
print(f"Dead latents: {result.dead_latents}")
print(f"Shrinkage: {result.shrinkage:.3f}")
print(f"Precision: {result.classification.precision:.3f}")
print(f"Recall: {result.classification.recall:.3f}")
print(f"F1: {result.classification.f1_score:.3f}")
```

### Metrics

- **MCC (Mean Correlation Coefficient)**: Measures alignment between SAE decoder weights and true feature vectors. Uses the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal one-to-one matching, then computes mean absolute cosine similarity. Range [0, 1] where 1 = perfect recovery. See the paper [Compute Optimal Inference and Provable Amortisation Gap in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13117) for more details.
- **Explained Variance (R²)**: Fraction of input variance explained by the SAE reconstruction. 1.0 = perfect reconstruction.
- **Uniqueness**: Fraction of SAE latents that track unique ground-truth features (i.e., no two latents map to the same ground-truth feature). 1.0 = all unique.
- **Classification (Precision/Recall/F1)**: Treats each SAE latent as a binary classifier for its best-matching ground-truth feature. Precision = TP/(TP+FP), Recall = TP/(TP+FN), F1 = harmonic mean.
- **L0**: Average number of active SAE latents per sample. Compare to `true_l0` to check if sparsity matches.
- **Dead latents**: Number of SAE latents that never activate. High values indicate capacity issues.
- **Shrinkage**: Ratio of SAE output norm to input norm. Values below 1.0 indicate the SAE is shrinking reconstructions.

### Visualization

Use [plot_sae_feature_similarity][sae_lens.synthetic.plot_sae_feature_similarity] to visualize how SAE features align with ground truth:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import plot_sae_feature_similarity

plot_sae_feature_similarity(sae, feature_dict, reorder_sae_latents=True)
```

This creates a heatmap showing cosine similarity between each SAE latent and each true feature.

## Realistic Data Properties

### Firing Probability Distributions

Real neural network features follow power-law distributions where few features fire frequently and most fire rarely. Use [zipfian_firing_probabilities][sae_lens.synthetic.zipfian_firing_probabilities]:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import zipfian_firing_probabilities

# Power-law distribution: some features common, most rare
firing_probs = zipfian_firing_probabilities(
    num_features=16,
    exponent=1.0,
    max_prob=0.5,
    min_prob=0.01,
)
```

Other options:
- [linear_firing_probabilities][sae_lens.synthetic.linear_firing_probabilities]: Linearly decreasing from max to min
- [random_firing_probabilities][sae_lens.synthetic.random_firing_probabilities]: Uniform random within bounds

### Feature Correlations

Features in real networks often co-occur or anti-occur. Add correlations with [generate_random_correlation_matrix][sae_lens.synthetic.generate_random_correlation_matrix]:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import generate_random_correlation_matrix

correlation_matrix = generate_random_correlation_matrix(
    num_features=16,
    uncorrelated_ratio=0.3,        # 30% of pairs have no correlation
    positive_ratio=0.7,            # 70% of correlations are positive
    min_correlation_strength=0.3,
    max_correlation_strength=0.8,
)

activation_gen = ActivationGenerator(
    num_features=16,
    firing_probabilities=firing_probs,
    correlation_matrix=correlation_matrix,
)
```

### Hierarchical Features

Model parent-child feature relationships where children can only fire when parents are active. Use [HierarchyNode][sae_lens.synthetic.HierarchyNode]:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import HierarchyNode, hierarchy_modifier

# Feature 0 is parent of features 1 and 2
# Feature 1 is parent of feature 3
hierarchy = HierarchyNode.from_dict({
    0: {
        1: {3: {}},
        2: {},
    }
})

modifier = hierarchy_modifier(hierarchy)

activation_gen = ActivationGenerator(
    num_features=4,
    firing_probabilities=torch.ones(4) * 0.5,
    modify_activations=modifier,
)
```

With hierarchies, you may observe **feature absorption**: when a child always fires with its parent, the SAE learns to encode both in a single latent.

## Advanced Topics

### Superposition

Create superposition by having more features than hidden dimensions:

```python
# 32 features in 16-dimensional space = 2x superposition
feature_dict = FeatureDictionary(num_features=32, hidden_dim=16)
```

With superposition, features must share directions, making recovery harder. The `orthogonal_initializer()` can only make features approximately orthogonal when `num_features > hidden_dim`.

### Custom Activation Modifiers

Create custom modifiers to implement arbitrary activation transformations. A modifier is a function `(activations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor`:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import ActivationsModifier

def my_modifier(activations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Example: zero out feature 0 when feature 1 is active
    result = activations.clone()
    mask = activations[:, 1] > 0
    result[mask, 0] = 0
    return result

activation_gen = ActivationGenerator(
    num_features=16,
    firing_probabilities=firing_probs,
    modify_activations=my_modifier,
)
```

Pass a list of modifiers to apply them in sequence.


## Large-Scale Training with SyntheticModel

For training SAEs on larger synthetic datasets with features like checkpointing, wandb logging, and HuggingFace integration, use [SyntheticModel][sae_lens.synthetic.SyntheticModel] and [SyntheticSAERunner][sae_lens.synthetic.SyntheticSAERunner].

### SyntheticModel

[SyntheticModel][sae_lens.synthetic.SyntheticModel] combines all synthetic data components into a single, configurable model:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import SyntheticModel, SyntheticModelConfig

cfg = SyntheticModelConfig(
    num_features=10_000,
    hidden_dim=512,
)
model = SyntheticModel(cfg)

# Generate training data
hidden_activations = model.sample(batch_size=1024)

# Or get both hidden activations and ground-truth features
hidden_acts, feature_acts = model.sample_with_features(batch_size=1024)
```

### SyntheticModelConfig

[SyntheticModelConfig][sae_lens.synthetic.SyntheticModelConfig] provides declarative configuration for all model properties:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import (
    SyntheticModelConfig,
    ZipfianFiringProbabilityConfig,
    HierarchyConfig,
    OrthogonalizationConfig,
    LowRankCorrelationConfig,
    LinearMagnitudeConfig,
    FoldedNormalMagnitudeConfig,
)

cfg = SyntheticModelConfig(
    num_features=16_384,
    hidden_dim=768,

    # Zipfian firing probabilities: few features fire often, most are rare
    firing_probability=ZipfianFiringProbabilityConfig(
        exponent=0.5,
        max_prob=0.4,
        min_prob=5e-4,
    ),

    # Hierarchical features with mutual exclusion
    hierarchy=HierarchyConfig(
        total_root_nodes=128,
        branching_factor=4,
        max_depth=3,
        mutually_exclusive_portion=1.0,  # All children are mutually exclusive
        compensate_probabilities=True,  # Try to compensate firing probabilities for hierarchy effects
        scale_children_by_parent=True,  # Scale child activations by parent activation / parent mean
    ),

    # Orthogonalize feature vectors to reduce overlap
    orthogonalization=OrthogonalizationConfig(
        num_steps=100,
        lr=3e-4,
    ),

    # Low-rank feature correlations
    correlation=LowRankCorrelationConfig(
        rank=25,
        correlation_scale=0.1,
    ),

    # Per-feature magnitude variation
    mean_firing_magnitudes=LinearMagnitudeConfig(start=5.0, end=4.0),
    std_firing_magnitudes=FoldedNormalMagnitudeConfig(mean=0.5, std=0.5),

    seed=42,
)

model = SyntheticModel(cfg, device="cuda")
```

This configuration is similar to [SynthSAEBench-16k](synth_sae_bench.md), which provides a standardized benchmark model for SAE evaluation.

### Automatic Hierarchy Generation

Use [HierarchyConfig][sae_lens.synthetic.HierarchyConfig] to automatically generate hierarchical feature structures:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import HierarchyConfig

hierarchy_cfg = HierarchyConfig(
    total_root_nodes=100,           # Number of root features
    branching_factor=10,            # Children per parent (or tuple for range)
    max_depth=2,                    # Maximum tree depth
    mutually_exclusive_portion=0.3, # Fraction of parents with ME children
    mutually_exclusive_min_depth=0, # Minimum depth for ME
    mutually_exclusive_max_depth=None, # Maximum depth for ME
    compensate_probabilities=False,  # Adjust probs for hierarchy effects
    scale_children_by_parent=False, # Scale child activations by parent activation / parent mean
)
```

With `compensate_probabilities=True`, firing probabilities are scaled up to compensate for the reduction to base firing probabilities caused by hierarchy constraints (children only fire when parents fire). Hierarchy works by disabling child features when their parent features are not active, which reduces the effective firing probability of the child features.

This setting likely only makes sense when using a Zipfian firing probability distribution, and it may be impossible to fully compensate probabilities, especially with mutually exclusive children. If you don't care about each feature's individual firing probability roughly matching the value you set for `firing_probability`, you can just set this to False.

With `scale_children_by_parent=True`, child activations are scaled by parent activation / parent mean. The intuition is that if a parent feature like "dog" is active much more strongly (or weakly) than usual, then a child feature like "Golden Retriever" should also have its activation scaled up (or down) proportionally. Setting this to True effectively makes the firing magnitudes of the parent/child features more correlated.

### Per-Feature Magnitude Distributions

Configure how firing magnitudes vary across features:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import (
    ConstantMagnitudeConfig,
    LinearMagnitudeConfig,
    ExponentialMagnitudeConfig,
    FoldedNormalMagnitudeConfig,
)

# All features have magnitude 1.0
constant = ConstantMagnitudeConfig(value=1.0)

# Linear interpolation from 0.5 to 2.0 across features
linear = LinearMagnitudeConfig(start=0.5, end=2.0)

# Exponential interpolation
exponential = ExponentialMagnitudeConfig(start=0.1, end=10.0)

# Random magnitudes from folded normal distribution
random = FoldedNormalMagnitudeConfig(mean=1.0, std=0.3)
```

### Training with SyntheticSAERunner

[SyntheticSAERunner][sae_lens.synthetic.SyntheticSAERunner] provides full training infrastructure:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import SyntheticSAERunner, SyntheticSAERunnerConfig
from sae_lens import BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig, LoggingConfig

runner_cfg = SyntheticSAERunnerConfig(
    # Load a pretrained synthetic model from HuggingFace
    synthetic_model="decoderesearch/synth-sae-bench-16k-v1",

    sae=BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig(
        d_in=768,   # Must match hidden_dim of the synthetic model
        d_sae=4096,
        k=25,
    ),

    # Training parameters
    training_samples=200_000_000,
    batch_size=1024,
    lr=3e-4,

    # Output
    output_path="output",

    # Evaluation
    eval_frequency=1000,  # Evaluate metrics every N steps
    eval_samples=500_000,

    # Performance (recommended for modern GPUs)
    autocast_sae=True,
    autocast_data=True,

    # Logging
    logger=LoggingConfig(
        log_to_wandb=True,
        wandb_project="my_project",
        wandb_entity="my_team",  # Optional
        run_name="my-run",       # Auto-generated if not set
        wandb_log_frequency=100,  # Log metrics every N training steps
    ),

    device="cuda",
)

runner = SyntheticSAERunner(runner_cfg)
result = runner.run()

print(f"Final MCC: {result.final_eval.mcc:.3f}")
print(f"Final explained variance: {result.final_eval.explained_variance:.3f}")
```

The `logger` parameter accepts a [LoggingConfig][sae_lens.config.LoggingConfig] that controls Weights & Biases integration, same as for the [LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig][sae_lens.LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig].

See [SynthSAEBench](synth_sae_bench.md) for a standardized benchmark workflow and examples with other SAE architectures.

#### Training on a temporary model

You can also pass in a SyntheticModelConfig directly to the runner, which will create a temporary model just for the training run.

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import SyntheticSAERunner, SyntheticSAERunnerConfig
from sae_lens import BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig, LoggingConfig

runner_cfg = SyntheticSAERunnerConfig(
    # Create a temporary synthetic model from config
    synthetic_model=SyntheticModelConfig(
        num_features=16_384,
        hidden_dim=768,
        # ... other config fields ...
    ),

    sae=BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig(
        d_in=768,
        d_sae=4096,
        k=25,
    ),

    # Training parameters
    training_samples=200_000_000,
    batch_size=1024,
    lr=3e-4,
)

runner = SyntheticSAERunner(runner_cfg)
result = runner.run()
```

### Saving and Loading Models

Save and load synthetic models for reproducibility:

```python
# Save to disk
model.save("./my_synthetic_model")

# Load from disk
model = SyntheticModel.load_from_disk("./my_synthetic_model")

# Smart loading from various sources
model = SyntheticModel.load_from_source(cfg)  # From config
model = SyntheticModel.load_from_source("./path")  # From disk
model = SyntheticModel.load_from_source("username/repo")  # From HuggingFace
```

### HuggingFace Integration

Share synthetic models via HuggingFace Hub:

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import (
    SyntheticModel,
    upload_synthetic_model_to_huggingface,
)

# Upload a model
upload_synthetic_model_to_huggingface(
    model=model,  # Or path to saved model
    hf_repo_id="username/my-synthetic-model",
)

# Load from HuggingFace
model = SyntheticModel.from_pretrained("username/my-synthetic-model")

# Load from a subfolder in a repo
model = SyntheticModel.from_pretrained(
    "username/repo",
    model_path="models/large",
)
```

An example of this is the [SynthSAEBench-16k](synth_sae_bench.md) model, which is uploaded to HuggingFace Hub.

```python
from sae_lens.synthetic import SyntheticModel

model = SyntheticModel.from_pretrained("decoderesearch/synth-sae-bench-16k-v1")
```

### Using Pretrained Synthetic Models with Runner

Load a pretrained synthetic model for training:

```python
from sae_lens import BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig

runner_cfg = SyntheticSAERunnerConfig(
    # Load from HuggingFace
    synthetic_model="username/my-synthetic-model",

    # Or from disk
    # synthetic_model="./path/to/model",

    sae=BatchTopKTrainingSAEConfig(
        d_in=768,
        d_sae=4096,
        k=34,
    ),
    training_samples=200_000_000,
)
```
